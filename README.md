# stm32_sd_firmware
Firmware development for interfacing SD/MMC card with STM32 microcontroller.
# SD/MMC Card Interface Firmware for STM32 (Embedded Systems)

## 🚀 Project Overview
This repository contains firmware development for interfacing an **SD/MMC card with an STM32 microcontroller**, supporting file operations like **read, write, and delete**. The firmware is optimized for **low power, secure storage, and high performance**.

## 📌 Features
✅ **SPI-based SD/MMC Communication** (Supports FAT32 & exFAT)  
✅ **DMA Acceleration** for high-speed data transfer  
✅ **Wear Leveling & Error Correction** (Enhancing SD card lifespan)  
✅ **AES-128/256 Secure Data Storage**  
✅ **Power Optimization & Low-Power Sleep Modes**  
✅ **FreeRTOS-based Task Management** *(Multitasking support)*  
✅ **Over-The-Air (OTA) Firmware Updates** *(via ESP32 Wi-Fi module - Future Work)*

## 🔧 Hardware Requirements
- **STM32 Development Board** (Recommended: STM32F4, STM32F1, or STM32G0 series)
- **SD/MMC Card Module** (SPI-based)
- **USB-UART Converter** (For debugging)
- **Power Meter (Optional)** (For power consumption analysis)

## 🛠️ Software & Tools
- **VSCode + CMake + GCC (ARM toolchain)** *(Cross-platform development setup)*
- **STM32CubeMX & STM32CubeIDE** *(For STM32 configuration & initialization)*
- **STM32CubeProgrammer** *(For flashing firmware)*
- **FatFs File System Library** *(For FAT32/exFAT support)*
- **Python (Optional)** *(For automation & scripting)*

## ⚡ Installation & Setup (macOS M1 Compatible)
### **Step 1: Install ARM GCC Toolchain**
```bash
brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
```

### **Step 2: Install OpenOCD for Debugging**
```bash
brew install openocd
```

### **Step 3: Clone Repository & Build Project**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stm32_sd_firmware.git
cd stm32_sd_firmware
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. && make
